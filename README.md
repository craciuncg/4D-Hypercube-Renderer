# 4D-Hypercube-Renderer

The GUI is functional and can be used to interact better with the cube.

# Additional functions

The GUI has the ability to resize, rotate and change the color of the cube. It cannot fill the cube because otherwise you will not be able to see what`s going on.

# Bibliography

I got inspired to do this by the youtube channel called "The Coding Train". He also made the cube but i tried to do my own better version of this cube and added a GUI to interact with it.
I also used the wikipedia page as a reference for "Matrix Multiplication" and "Rotation Matrix". Links down below:
